# polished v0.5.0.9000

* Added `secure_render()`, which can be used to render and secure any Rmarkdown document. Rendering is handled by `rmarkdown::render` and the then the rendered document is secured with `polished` authentication.

# polished v0.5.0

* Added 4 additional Polished Hosting regions (see documentation for `region` argument of `polished::deploy_app()`)
* App names (i.e. `app_name`) can now include upper case letters & spaces (Example: `app_name = "Example App Name"`)
* added "cache" argument to `deploy()` app to set whether or not to use a cached build of your Shiny
app on Polished Hosting.
* added "golem_package_name" argument to `deploy_app()` to allow for deploying Golem Shiny apps
to Polished Hosting.
* removed options to pass an "account module" and/or a "splash page module" to the `secure_ui()` and
`secure_server()` functions.  These were experimental arguments for extending polished. We now have a better generalized solution for extending polished -- more to come soon.
* export the `api_list_to_df` function
* added new `cookie_expires` argument to `global_sessions_config()`, allowing you to set the cookie expiration for app users

# polished v0.4.0

* created API wrapper functions for programmatically managing users, apps, user invites,
roles, etc.  See the new API Wrappers vignette for details (`vignette("api_wrappers", package = "polished")`).
* added 93 new tests for the above mentioned new API wrapper functions.
* removed `api_url` argument from `global_sessions_config()`.  This argument is only used
internally during development, so there is no reason to expose it to package users.
* Bug Fix: fixed check for user already registered during sign in process.
* added `button_color` argument to `sign_in_ui_default()`.
* added `tlmgr` argument to `deploy_app()` which allows support for generating pdf documents from 
Rmarkdown.

# polished v0.3.0

* created new `deploy_app()` function for deploying apps to Polished Hosting.
* removed dependencies on `shinydashboardPlus` due to breaking change with `dashboardHeaderPlus()` and `dashboardPagePlus()`.
* `sign_out_from_shiny()` can now be used in the `session$onSessionEnded()` or `onStop()` to sign the user
out when the user's session ends.
* added support for package dependency detection (#129)
* added cookie options { sameSite: "none", secure: true } when the app is being served over https.  This allows polished authentication to work in an iframe on most browsers.
* added email validation to email inputs in the sign in and registration modules. 
* allow for a function UI be passed to the "ui" argument of `secure_ui()`.
* added "redirect_page" argument to `sign_out_from_shiny()`
* new "is_auth_required" argument added to `global_sessions_config()` which (when set to FALSE) allows users to access your app without being signed in.  By default this argument is set to TRUE. (#109)
* moved toast notification to top (better for mobile) and extended showDuration. (#107)

# polished v0.2.0

* New "account" and "splash" pages.  We will share more on these new pages in upcoming blog posts. 
* Added "is_email_verification_required" argument to `global_sessions_config()` that allows you to disable email verification.
* Admin Panel > User Access * added a checkbox to send an email invite to a newly newly invited user 
* removed usage dashboard from "Admin Panel".  This dashboard has been superseded by the dashboard at
https://dashboard.polished.tech (#102)
* added "background_image" argument to `sign_in_ui_default()` to allow for a full screen image for the sign in page background. 
* only use the "email" sign in provider by default rather than c("google", "email")
* added customizable sign out button to `secure_static()` (#93)
* standardized and documented process for using fully customized sign in and registration pages (#92).  New functions `sign_in_js()` and `sign_in_check_jwt()`, and new vignette on how to use these functions to create fully customized sign in and registration pages.
* add sign_in_module_2 as an alternative premade sign in page.  sign_in_module_2 is designed to look nice when using social sign in
providers (like Google and Microsoft) in addition to email/password.
* Removed sign_in_no_invite_module.  sign_in_module and sign_in_module_2 now have an "is_invite_requirement" argument, so there is no longer a need for a dedicated sign_in_no_invite_module.


# polished v0.1.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Initial CRAN release of polished
